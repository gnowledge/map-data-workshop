# OSM Tiles with Tilestrata

Download an OpenStreetMap extract, put it into a PostGIS database, customize the OSM-Bright style
for our needs, and run a tile server that caches tiles to disk with Tilestrata.

## Running
````
node server.js
````

Tiles will then be available at `http://localhost:8080/tiles/basemap/{z}/{x}/{y}/tile.png`, or whatever port is provided.

## Use
To use the tiles in Leaflet:
````
L.tileLayer('http://maps.metastudio.org/tiles/basemap/{z}/{x}/{y}/tile.png', {
  maxZoom: 21,
  attribution: 'Data &copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap contributors</a> | Style by <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/osm-bright">Mapbox</a>'
});

````

## Setup

*Assumes you have Postgresql with PostGIS, osm2pgsql, git, and curl installed. Will also download and import the
Mumbai metro extract.*

First download the Mumbai metro extract (or any other OSM extract in PBF), shapefiles that we need, and install `carto` globally:

````
npm install
./setup.sh
sudo npm install -g carto
cp osm-bright/configure.py.sample osm-bright/configure.py
````

Next, edit `osm-bright/configure.py`:
  - path (`getcwd()`)
  - host (`localhost`)
  - port (`5432`)
  - dbname (`osm`)
  - user (your username)
  - password
  - land-high (`path.join(path.dirname(getcwd()) + "/shp/land_polygons/land-polygons-split-3857/land_polygons.shp")`)
  - land-low (`path.join(path.dirname(getcwd()) + "/shp/simplified_land_polygons/simplified-land-polygons-complete-3857/simplified_land_polygons.shp")`)


Build the `project.mml` file for `osm-bright`, clean up the errors, and convert it to a Mapnik XML file
````
cd osm-bright
./make.py

cd ..
node setup.js

cd osm-bright/OSMBright/
carto project_mod.mml > mapnik.xml
````

You should now be able to run `node server.js`.


## Seeding the cache
Tiles can be slow to generate for the first time, so it is often prudent to warm the tile cache on disk.

1. `cp setup/credentials.example.js setup.credentials.js`
2. Edit `setup/credentials.js` with your information
3. Make sure the zoom level and template URL parameters at the top of `setup/seedCache.js` are accurate
4. Run `node setup/seedCache.js`. It will take a few minutes, and for all of India will result in a cache size of about 150MB.
